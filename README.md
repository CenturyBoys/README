# Centuryboys Manifesto

## About Us

**Centuryboys** is an organization dedicated to developing tools that help the developer community. Our goal is to give back to the community with open-source code, providing useful and accessible solutions that anyone can use and improve.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to create and maintain libraries and software tools that facilitate project development in various areas of technology. We believe that by sharing our code and knowledge, we can contribute to the growth and innovation within the developer community.

## Our Values

- **Collaboration:** We promote an environment where everyone is welcome to contribute, learn, and grow together.
- **Accessibility:** We strive to create tools that are easy to use and accessible to all developers, regardless of their experience level.
- **Gratitude:** Our projects are a way to give back to the open-source community, providing valuable resources and sharing knowledge.

## Our Projects

Currently, **Centuryboys** mainly maintains libraries in Python and one in Dart. Here are some of the projects we are working on:

### Python
- **[Clandestino](https://github.com/CenturyBoys/clandestino):** A migration tool for Python projects.
- **[Romeways](https://github.com/CenturyBoys/romeways):** A queue framework.
- **[My-Mimic](https://github.com/CenturyBoys/my-mimic):** A cache package.
- **[Meeseeks-Singleton](https://github.com/CenturyBoys/meeseeks-singleton):** A Singleton pattern implementation for Python.
- **[Witch-Doctor](https://github.com/CenturyBoys/witch-doctor):** Dependency injection for Python.

### Dart
- **[Witch-Doctor-Dart](https://github.com/CenturyBoys/witch-doctor-dart):** Dependency injection for Dart.

Projects are chosen based on the needs of our founder and are developed to have general characteristics, allowing them to be employed in a wide range of other projects.

## Our Development Philosophy

We chose the Apache 2.0 license for our projects to ensure that our code can be used openly and freely, promoting innovation and collaboration. While we are still developing specific guidelines for external contributions, we encourage the community to get involved and help improve our projects.

## Contributor Expectations

While we are still drafting our contribution policies, we expect all contributors to adhere to the following principles:

- **Respect and Inclusion:** Treat all community members with respect and promote an inclusive environment.
- **Quality and Maintenance:** Contribute high-quality, well-documented, and tested code.

## The Future of Centuryboys

Our goal is to continue expanding our project portfolio and attract more developers to collaborate with us. We aim to create a positive and lasting impact on the developer community, making technology more accessible and useful for everyone.

Thank you for your interest in **Centuryboys** and we hope our projects are useful to you. Join us on this journey of innovation and collaboration!
